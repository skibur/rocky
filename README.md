<i>"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux"</i><br>

## About

Rocky Linux is a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, now that CentOS has shifted direction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> **Q:** What do you mean, "CentOS has shifted direction?"

The CentOS project [recently announced](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) a shift in strategy for CentOS. Whereas previously CentOS existed as a *downstream* build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (it receives patches and updates after RHEL does), it will be shifting to an *upstream* build (testing patches and updates before inclusion in RHEL).

Additionally, support for CentOS Linux 8 has been cut short, from May 31, 2029 to December 31, 2021.

> **Q:** So where does Rocky Linux come in?

Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to Red Hat Enterprise, not before.
